Cable News Network (CNN) is an American news-based pay television channel owned by Turner Broadcasting System, a division of AT&T's WarnerMedia.[1] CNN was founded in 1980 by American media proprietor Ted Turner as a 24-hour cable news channel.[2] Upon its launch, CNN was the first television channel to provide 24-hour news coverage,[3] and was the first all-news television channel in the United States.[4]

While the news channel has numerous affiliates, CNN primarily broadcasts from the Time Warner Center in New York City, and studios in Washington, D.C. and Los Angeles. Its headquarters at the CNN Center in Atlanta is only used for weekend programming. CNN is sometimes referred to as CNN/U.S. (or CNN Domestic[5]) to distinguish the American channel from its international sister network, CNN International.
